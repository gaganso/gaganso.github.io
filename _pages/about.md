I am a computer science Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University working in the [PACE lab](http://www.pace.cs.stonybrook.edu/) under the guidance [Prof. Anshul Gandhi](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~anshul/). I am broadly interested in the area of performance analysis and modeling of computer systems. Recently, I have been working on performance analysis of distributed applications implemented using the microservices architecture.
